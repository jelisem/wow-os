## Sounds Like
- "We want everyone to feel safe speaking up—even if they disagree."
- "We’re aiming for real buy-in, not just silent agreement."
- "I want our team to move quickly, but still make space for all voices."

## Looks Like
- Group decisions include signals of shared support and space for dissent  
- Participation is high across roles, levels, and personalities  
- Misalignment is surfaced early and handled constructively  

## What Might Be Behind This
- A push toward more equitable, participatory culture  
- Past experiences where silence was mistaken for support  
- New team members or trust-building needs in a hybrid team  

## Can Be Confused With
- A desire for unanimity rather than consent  
- “Democratizing everything” instead of clarifying decision rights  

## Risks of Inaction
- Inclusion becomes performative rather than practiced  
- Good ideas go unheard  
- Decisions get revisited or delayed due to unclear alignment  

## What Success Looks Like
- People of all roles and identities feel safe expressing both support and concern  
- Alignment checks are routine, not rare  
- Trust grows because input leads to meaningful action
