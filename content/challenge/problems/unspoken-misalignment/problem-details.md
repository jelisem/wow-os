## Sounds Like
- "We left the meeting thinking we all agreed, but turns out, we didn’t."
- "No one said anything at the time, but now we're hearing about all kinds of problems."
- "I thought we had a decision, but nothing happened, and now we're meeting to decide again."

## Looks Like
- Quiet agreement followed by backchannel pushback  
- Delays in action despite apparent consensus  
- Teams avoid naming disagreement in group settings  

## What Might Be Behind This
- Psychological safety is low  
- Time pressure creates false closure  
- No clear way to express hesitation or dissent  

## Can Be Confused With
- Passive resistance  
- Poor decision clarity  
- “Lack of accountability”  

## Risks of Inaction
- Decisions unravel later  
- Trust deteriorates  
- Rework and hidden dissent slow progress  

## What Success Looks Like
- Misalignment is surfaced in the moment  
- Teams move forward with shared understanding  
- Concerns are expressed early and used constructively
