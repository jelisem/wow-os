# Example Questions and Rating Scales for Use with Zero to Five Checks

The examples here are formatted for easy copy and paste into a meeting or group chat.  When you un these checks verbally, we recommend only defining 1, 3, and 5 out loud. This keeps the activity quick and simple.  

For example, you might say: 

> Let's check our energy. When I say, hold up your hand showing your rating 
> on a scale from "5 = Woo hoo!" to "Fist = nearly dead"  with "3 = Fine, thanks." 
> Ok? 3, 2, 1... what's your energy level right now?
