    description: Often attributed to a 2004 publication by the American Youth
      Foundation, its roots are intertwined with earlier consensus-building
      practices from activist and participatory democracy movements in the late
      20th century. Jean Tabaka helped spread the method to the software
      development community by including it in the 2006 publication of
      'Collaboration Explained' as a team alignment and consent technique using
      a five-finger scale.
